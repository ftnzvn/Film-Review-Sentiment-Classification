# Sentiment Analysis for Film Reviews Using Pytorch
This project includes a text sentiment classification model that aims to classify film reviews as positive or negative.
The model is built using PyTorch and uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to understand the sentiment expressed in each review.

The dataset consists of a mixture of both real and fictional movie reviews, with each review labeled as either:
Positive (1): The review expresses a positive sentiment.
Negative (0): The review expresses a negative sentiment.

You can replace these with your own data.
